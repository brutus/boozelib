""" Calculate blood alcohol content.

Functions to calculate the **blood alcohol content** of people.

Functions
=========

The two main functions are:

* ``get_blood_alcohol_content(age, weight, height, sex, volume, percent)``

  Returns the **Blood Alcohol Content** (raise) for a person with the given
  stats after a drink containing *volume* ml of alcohol with the given *percent*
  (vol/vol).

* ``get_degradation(age, weight, height, sex, minutes)``

  Returns the **alcohol degradation** (per mill) of a person with the given
  stats in the given number of *minutes*.

Examples
--------

>>> get_blood_alcohol_content(
...     age=32, weight=96, height=186, sex=False, volume=500, percent=4.9
... )
0.28773587455687716

>>> get_blood_alcohol_content(
...     age=32, weight=48, height=162, sex=True, volume=500, percent=4.9
... )
0.5480779730398769

>>> get_degradation(age=32, weight=96, height=186, sex=False, minutes=60)
0.21139778538872606

>>> get_degradation(age=32, weight=48, height=162, sex=True, minutes=60)
0.20133476560648536
