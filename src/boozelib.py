""" Calculate blood alcohol content.

Functions to calculate the **blood alcohol content** of people.

Global Variables
================

This uses some constants and one variable you might want to review:

- :data:`ALCOHOL_DEGRADATION`: the default value for alcohol degradation;
  meaning the amount of alcohol (in gram) your body is degrading per minute, per
  kilogram body weight. This is usually a value between ``0.0017`` and
  ``0.0025`` (about 0.1â€”0.2 per thousand per hour).

Functions
=========

The two main functions are:

- ``get_blood_alcohol_content(age, weight, height, sex, volume, percent)``

    Return the **blood alcohol contents** raise (per mill) for a person after a
    drink.

    Given a drink containing *volume* (ml) of alcohol with the *percent*
    (vol/vol), for a person with *age* (years), *weight* (kg) and *height* (cm),
    using the formular for "female body types" if *sex* is true.

- ``get_blood_alcohol_degradation(
        age, weight, height, sex, minutes=1, degradation=None,
    )``

    Return the alcohol degradation (per mill) for a person over *minutes*.

    For a person with *age* (years), *weight* (kg) and *height* (cm), using the
    formular for "female body types" if *sex* is true, over the given *minutes*.
    If *degradation* is not set, :data:`ALCOHOL_DEGRADATION` is used as default.

Examples
--------

Return the **blood alcohol contents** raise (per mill) for a person after a
drink:

>>> get_blood_alcohol_content(
...     age=32, weight=96, height=186, sex=False, volume=500, percent=4.9
... )
0.28773587455687716

>>> get_blood_alcohol_content(
...     age=32, weight=48, height=162, sex=True, volume=500, percent=4.9
... )
0.5480779730398769

And to calculate alcohol degradation:

>>> get_blood_alcohol_degradation(
...     age=32, weight=96, height=186, sex=False, minutes=60
... )
0.21139778538872606

>>> get_blood_alcohol_degradation(
...     age=32, weight=48, height=162, sex=True, minutes=60
... )
0.20133476560648536

You can change the default for *alcohol degradation* globally via setting
:data:`ALCOHOL_DEGRADATION`. Or change the value for *alcohol degradation* per
call:

>>> get_blood_alcohol_degradation(
...     age=32, weight=48, height=162, sex=True, minutes=60, degradation=0.002
... )
0.16106781248518828
