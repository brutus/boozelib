## 0.7.0 (2021-03-08)

### Features

- âž• Added `sphinx-autobuild` for doc generation.
- âœ¨ Add optional argument **degradation** to the
  `calculate_alcohol_degradation` and `get_blood_alcohol_degradation`
  functions.

  If set, this value is used for _alcohol degradation_ instead of the
  `ALCOHOL_DEGRADATION` module level variable.

### Deprecations and Removals

- In the next version the value used for _alcohol degradation_ will be lowered.

  To keep the current default, you can override `ALCOHOL_DEGRADATION`, or use
  the new **degradation** argument to the `calculate_alcohol_degradation` and
  `get_blood_alcohol_degradation` functions.


## 0.6.0 (2021-02-02)

### Features

- Added Python [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).
- Use [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) to check type hints.

### Changes

- Renamed the used constants (use decriptive names).
- Ported the README to markdown.
- Switched to [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging (from
  [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)).
- Only accept keyword-arguments for all functions (not positional ones).
- Switch back to [ward](https://wardpy.com/) as test framework.
- Translated the background section in the docs.
- Rename `calculate_alcohol` to `calculate_alcohol_weight`,
  `calculate_degradation` to `calculate_alcohol_degradation` and
  `get_degradation` to `get_blood_alcohol_degradation`.
- Unified function signatures.

### Deprecations and Removals

- Remove deprecated function names (`calculate_bw` and `get_bac`).
- Remove support for Python `==2.7`.
